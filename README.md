# Online-Course-Materials-Management-System:
 - Used html and css3 for the webpage designing and formatting.
 - Used PHP for the backend code, and MySql for handling the database for the project
 - Followed a MVC Structure to organizse the whole bunhc of codes, and created eparate branches for them in this repository.
 - Would soon be committing changes to the original code, as I am shifting to Laravel for it.

# Project Description:
 - This Project is for both the students and teachers who are trying to learn and teach courses online. 
 - I know, MOOC Courses are nowadays the goto courses students can take sitting at their homes, and learn a lot. In order to handle the courses, I tried to create this website. 
 - Basically, students can login and see the uplaoded contents of any course of three deaprtments i.e CSE, EEE and BBA, as of now.
 - Instructors can, in turn uplaod contents and also provide assignments to the students, and can also add or delete any student from the list, as a student can drop the course anytime. 
 
# Project Scope:
 - Any university working on building a personal website such as edX or coursera or udemy, can use this template as basic, and extend other features needed to finally build a complete MOOC website out of ir.
